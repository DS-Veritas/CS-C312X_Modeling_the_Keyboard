## CS-C312X_Modeling_the_Keyboard
A Python based assignment for the course Human Computer Interaction (CS-C3120) that calculate the optimal design of the QWERTY keyboard based on the Fitts' Law and several other factors.

### Motivation
Fitts law has become more and more important as new products are developed and especially new user interfaces requiring touch interaction. Fitts law is very important in considering the usability of mobile keyboards. There are many keys that need to fit on a small screen, all within close proximity to each other. The law becomes important when determining how far apart keys should be and where they are located. We can see that Apple has done many studies considering this law when creating their keyboards. On the iPad, users can split the keyboard into two to make it easier to type holding the iPad in both hands. On the iPhone, we can see that the keyboard can be changed to view more characters and the keyboard adjusts when just inputing numbers to make it easier to select keys. If Fitts law isn't taken into consideration we would have a very hard time using our mobile keyboards.

### Objectives
In this research, we examine some representative scientific evidence of climate changing, and attempt to model and extrapolate the global mean temperature using various prediction models.
